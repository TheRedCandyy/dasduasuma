# Sensorial Experience Redesign Plan

## Overview

Transform the current sensorial experience section into an exclusive, interactive, step-by-step guided journey that requires a code (found on the cork of wine bottles) to access.

## Key Features

### 1. Code-Protected Access

- Create a code entry form on the homepage where the sensorial experience section currently exists
- The code will be found on the cork of Das Duas Uma wine bottles
- Implement validation for the codes
- Store accessed codes to prevent repeated entry requirement

### 2. Countdown Transition

- After successful code entry, implement a 3-2-1 countdown animation
- Use smooth transitions and animations for a premium feel
- Consider adding subtle sound effects if sound is enabled

### 3. Step-by-Step Experience

- Transform the experience into a linear, guided journey
- Each section appears one at a time, with no option to go back
- Clear "Next" buttons/indicators to progress through the experience
- Progress indicator to show how far along the user is in the experience

### 4. Sticky Scroll Sections

- Implement sticky scrolling behavior for each section of the experience
- Each section takes up the full viewport
- Sections snap into place when scrolling
- Smooth transitions between sections

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Code Entry & Validation

- Create code entry UI
- Implement code validation mechanism
- Setup state management for tracking unlocked experiences

### Phase 2: Countdown Animation

- Design and implement the countdown animation
- Add transitions between code entry and experience start

### Phase 3: Step-by-Step Navigation

- Restructure the sensorial experience content for sequential viewing
- Implement one-way navigation through the experience
- Add progress tracking

### Phase 4: Sticky Scrolling

- Implement scroll snapping for sections
- Add smooth transitions between sections
- Ensure responsive behavior across devices

## Design Considerations

- Maintain the existing wine-themed aesthetic
- Focus on elegant, minimal animations
- Ensure the experience feels premium and exclusive
- Make sure the UI is intuitive despite the linear constraints

## Technical Approach

- Use React hooks for state management
- Consider Framer Motion for animations
- Implement IntersectionObserver for scroll effects
- Store unlocked experiences in localStorage or user accounts if applicable
