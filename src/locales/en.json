    "heroDescription2": "The idea is to walk the line between what some call complexity and others call a flaw. In the case of the white wine, we decided, in a controlled way, to introduce a deliberate 'defect' to give more complexity to the wine.",

      "description2": "Without enological additives, artificial corrections, or excessive manipulations, these wines preserve their authenticity by reflecting not only the grape variety but also the environment and time in which they were conceived."

        "title": "Diacetyl",
        "description": "A buttery aroma and flavor",
        "cause": "It is produced during malolactic fermentation and results from the degradation of citric acid after malic acid has been consumed. Only at high levels is it considered a defect. At appropriate levels, it can be advantageous."

        "title": "Oxidation",

        "cause": "Excessive contact of wine with oxygen, defective cork with poor tightness, fragile wine with low redox potential, advanced age of the wine."

      "title": "The Wine",
      "intro": "Each wine carries a story, and the journey begins with its first signs. Through attentive observation of its color, we can feel the touch of time and its complexity. Each shade tells a secret, each nuance of light reflects the character of the wine that is about to be unveiled.",
      "instructions": "Start by filling the glass to one-third of its capacity, leaving room for the wine to breathe. Now, prepare yourself for a complete experience: observe with your eyes, feel with your nose, and finally, let the wine touch your mouth, each sense revealing part of this story.",
      "eyes": {
        "title": "Eyes",
        "description": "The color of a white wine is the first sign of its time. When the tones dress in gold or amber, it means that time has left its marks — and with it came depth, maturity, and the promise of deeper and more complex flavors."
      },
      "nose": {
        "title": "Nose",
        "description1": "Approach the glass as if listening to a secret: without swirling, just feel the first breath of aromas that the wine reveals on its own.",
        "description2": "Then, make the wine dance in the glass. Let it spin with intensity, as if awakening from a deep sleep. Inhale again — now the aromas gain body, revealing layers that were previously sleeping in silence."

      "mouth": {
        "title": "Mouth",
        "description": "Now is the moment of encounter. The wine and the taster touch, like a gentle and delicate kiss. Let it spread, filling your mouth with a dance of flavors and textures."
      },
      "acetaldehyde": {
        "title": "Acetaldehyde",
        "description": "It is a chemical compound formed during fermentation and wine oxidation. It has a characteristic aroma of green apple, nuts, sherry, or even varnish. In some styles, such as Jerez Fino or Manzanilla, this aroma is desired. However, in wines that should not present it, it may indicate oxidation."
