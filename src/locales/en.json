      "description2": "Without enological additives, artificial corrections, or excessive manipulations, these wines preserve their authenticity by reflecting not only the grape variety but also the environment and time in which they were conceived."

      "diacetil": {
        "title": "Diacetyl",
        "description": "A buttery aroma and flavor",
        "cause": "It is produced during malolactic fermentation and results from the degradation of citric acid after malic acid has been consumed. Only at high levels is it considered a defect. At appropriate levels, it can be advantageous."
      },
      "oxidation": {
        "title": "Oxidation",
        "description": "A common defect particularly in white wines. Slight color change accompanied by an aroma with evident loss of fruit, 'past' apple, a certain woodiness and a flat taste with a dry and short finish.",
        "cause": "Excessive contact of wine with oxygen, defective cork with poor tightness, fragile wine with low redox potential, advanced age of the wine."
      },
      "cooked": {
        "title": "Cooked",
        "description": "Aroma without freshness, tired, stewed, thin taste, without body and personality.",
        "cause": "Wine exposed to high temperatures for a longer or shorter period of time. Unfortunately a common problem in many of our commercial establishments."
      },
      "acetaldehyde": {
        "title": "Acetaldehyde",
        "description": "Penetrating and characteristic aroma that can recall green apple, nuts, sherry, or even varnish. In small quantities, it can go unnoticed, but in excess, it is easily identified and considered a defect, except in specific styles like Fino Sherry or Manzanilla, where it is desired.",
        "cause": "Natural formation during alcoholic fermentation and especially during wine oxidation, when ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde through contact with oxygen. It can be a sign of poor conservation, defective corks, or prolonged exposure to air."

      "intro": "Each wine carries a story, and the journey begins with its first signs. Through attentive observation of its color, we can feel the touch of time and its complexity. Each shade tells a secret, each nuance of light reflects the character of the wine that is about to be unveiled.",
      "instructions": "Start by filling the glass to one-third of its capacity, leaving room for the wine to breathe. Now, prepare yourself for a complete experience: observe with your eyes, feel with your nose, and finally, let the wine touch your mouth, each sense revealing part of this story.",
      "eyes": {
        "title": "Eyes",
        "description": "The color of a white wine is the first sign of its time. When the tones dress in gold or amber, it means that time has left its marks — and with it came depth, maturity, and the promise of deeper and more complex flavors."
      },
      "nose": {
        "title": "Nose",
        "description1": "Approach the glass as if listening to a secret: without swirling, just feel the first breath of aromas that the wine reveals on its own.",
        "description2": "Then, make the wine dance in the glass. Let it spin with intensity, as if awakening from a deep sleep. Inhale again — now the aromas gain body, revealing layers that were previously sleeping in silence."

      "mouth": {
        "title": "Mouth",
        "description": "Finally, bring the wine to your mouth. Let it dance across your palate, feel its texture, the vibrant acidity, the subtle sweetness, the tannins that structure, and the alcohol that warms. The finish, the persistence of flavors after swallowing, is the last chapter of this sensory discovery, the wine's signature."
